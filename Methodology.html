          <h4>Methodology(point on time)</h4>
          <hr>
          <p>In the methodology section, the methods used for data gathering and analysis are discussed and explained. It will validate our findings, establish them in the context of our area, and provide our readers with a resource to refer to if they have any concerns or criticisms about the other aspects. An unduplicated count of all homeless individuals in a town, including both sheltered and unsheltered populations, is known as a point-in-time count. Point-in-time counts are significant because they define the scope of the homelessness issue and aid staff members and policymakers in monitoring progress toward the objective of eradicating homelessness.</p>
          <p>The completion of the enumeration survey, observational data, services system use data, and Homeless Individuals and Families Information System (HIFIS) data are all necessary for effective homeless services system planning. System data refers to information that may be given by Simcoe County hospitals, provincial correctional facilities, child welfare agencies, and other physical and mental health care facilities. essential types of information for the enumeration are the names and basic demographic data of those who stay at these institutions during Point-in-Time (PIT) Count nights.</p>
          <br>
          
        <P>The institutions listed below contribute useful information for the individuals who self-identify as not having their own (owned or rented) accommodation:</P>
    
        <ul>
            <li>1.Community Safety and Correctional Services for those who are lodged in jails and prisons as well as police holding cell data.</li>
            <li>2.Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care records on patients in general hospitals, mental institutions, and programs for addiction treatment and detoxification. </li>
            <li>3.Ministry of Children, Community, and Social Services data on children in foster care.</li>
        </ul><br>
          <p>The areas for the methodology survey include:- </p>
          <ul>
            <li>1.Barrie</li>
            <li>2.North Simcoe</li>

          <h4>Methodology-2018</h4>
          <hr>
          <P>The 2018 Homeless Enumeration was performed from April 24 to April 26, 2018, and it incorporated the methods of the Registry Week and Point-in-Time (PIT) Count. The Enumeration gave a general picture of homelessness in Simcoe County's rural areas, townships, towns, and cities throughout its five enumeration districts.  </P>
          <P>Registry Weeks are multi-day enumerations that collect information on people who are living in temporary housing, such as transitional housing or institutional care, as well as on the streets, in shelters, other unsheltered locations, and/or in sheltered places that are not fit for human habitation (like sheds, makeshift shelters, and tents). The first day of a combined PIT/Registry Week enumeration must be the PIT Count night, hence the Simcoe County PIT Count took place on Tuesday, April 24, 2018. On the PIT reference night, Tuesday, April 24, 2018, all survey respondents were asked where they stayed, regardless of which of the three days the surveys were administered. For the enumeration, only those who were homeless on April 24 were included.</P>
          <br>
          <p><u><b>Administration of surveys</b></u></p>
          <p>An overall number of 972 persons were contacted by volunteers to do the survey during the Point-in-Time Count (PIT)/Registry Week. Of these, 197 declined the offer to take part, 73 had already taken part, and 154 got rejected from doing the survey. Twelve respondents withdrew their agreement from the 548 surveys that were done, four surveys lacked consent forms, and the information from 25 duplicate surveys was not used. People who were temporarily sheltered or at risk of being homeless filled out 19 surveys. </p>
          <p>Surveys were carried out on an extensive number of unsheltered locations, such as parks, pathways, streets, alleys, and other open spaces, as well as emergency shelters, transitional housing facilities, motels, and other locations. Libraries, building vestibules and entrances, Ontario Works offices, and regional headquarters buildings were among the shelter spots. The survey sites included: </p>

        <ul>

            <li>1. Shelters and programs to get people out of the cold (n=148).</li>
            <li>2. Churches, libraries, and community services (n=126).</li>
            <li>3. Housing for transition (n=40).</li>
            <li>4. Unidentified towns and cities in the county (n=34).</li>
            <li>5. Hotels and programs that offer hotel vouchers (n=30).</li>
            <li>6. Outside of commercial structures, such as coffee shops and fast-food joints (n=29).</li>
            <li>7. Unsheltered areas, such as parks and bus stops (n = 27).</li>
            <li>8. Through the phone (n=7).</li>

          <h4>Methodology-2020</h4>
          <hr>
          <p>The 2020 Homeless Enumeration employed a combined Registry Week/Point-in-Time (PIT) Count technique and took place from November 17 to November 23, 2020. Since the PIT Count night must fall on the first day of the combined PIT/Registry Week enumeration, the Simcoe County PIT Count took place on Tuesday, November 17, 2020. All survey respondents were asked where they remained on the PIT reference night, Tuesday, November 17, 2020, regardless of the day the surveys were administered. Only those who were homeless on November 17th were counted as having been homeless at the time of the census.</p>
          <p>The survey sites included:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>1. Shelters or out-of-the-cold programs (n=199 or 53%)</li>
            <li>2. transitional housing (n=30 or 8%)</li>
            <li>3. In and around commercial buildings (n=28 or 7%)</li>
            <li>4. Over the phone (n=24 or 6%)</li>
            <li>5. Outdoor locations (n=22 or 6%)</li>
            <li>6. Within support programs (n=17 or 5%)</li>
            <li>7. Unspecified locations in Simcoe county towns and cities (n=11 or 3%)</li>
            <li>8. Corrections/hospitals/treatment centers (n=7 or 2%)</li>
            <li>9. Motels (n=7or 2%)</li>
            <li>10. Violence against women shelters (n=7 or 2%). </li>
            <li>11. Blank or another location on 7% or 25 surveys.</li>
          </ul>
          <p><u><b>Administration of surveys</b></u></p>
          <p>A total of 972 persons were contacted by volunteers to do the survey during the Point-in-Time Count (PIT)/Registry Week on November 17, 2020. Of these, 197 declined the offer to take part, 73 had already taken part, and 154 got rejected from doing the survey. Twelve respondents withdrew their agreement from the 548 surveys that were done, four surveys lacked consent forms, and the information from 25 duplicate surveys was not used. People who were temporarily sheltered or in danger of homelessness completed 19 questionnaires.</p>
          <p>On November 17th, 2020, it was discovered that 563 people in Simcoe County were homeless. This equals a rate of 10.5 per 10,000 persons. Through survey participation, agency occupancy, and observation tally counts, people were identified. 47% of those who were homeless were staying in an emergency shelter, 39% were receiving temporary housing, and 14% were living without shelter.</p>
          <p>Due to the above-mentioned survey methodological changes brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic, it is important to note that the proportion of homeless people staying in emergency shelters may be overrepresented in the results of the 2020 homeless enumeration, while the proportion of people staying in unsheltered locations may be underrepresented.</p>

          <h4>Methodology-2022</h4>
          <hr>
          <p>The 2022 Homeless Enumeration took place from January 25 to January 27. Point-in-Time Count (PIT) approach was employed on March 15th, 2022. The Enumeration gave a picture of homelessness in the rural regions, townships, cities, and municipalities of Simcoe County's five enumeration zones. Survey sites included:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>1. In shelters out-of-the-cold programs (n=258 or 59%)</li>
            <li>2. Transitional housing (n=63 or 14%) </li>
            <li>3. Unspecified locations in Simcoe county towns and cities (n=37 or 8%)</li>
            <li>4. Over the phone (n=32 or 7%)</li>
            <li>5. Violence against women shelters (n=13 or 3%)</li>
            <li>6. In and around commercial buildings (n=8 or 2%)</li>
            <li>7. Motels (n=8 or 2%)</li>
            <li>8. Community programs (n=7 or 2%)</li>
            <li>9. Corrections/hospitals/treatment centers (n=6 or 1%)</li>
            <li>10. Blank (n=9 or 2%) </li>
            <li>11. Blank or another location on 7% or 25 surveys.</li>
          </ul>
          <p><u><b>Administration of surveys</b></u></p>
          <p>On January 25th, 2022, it was discovered that 722 people in Simcoe County were homeless. This equals a rate of 13.2 per 10,000 persons. Through survey participation, agency occupancy, and observation tally counts, people were identified. This figure is higher than the 563 people that were discovered to be homeless in Simcoe County on November 17, 2020. 61% of those who were homeless in 2022 were staying in an emergency shelter, 35% were receiving temporary housing, and 4% were living without shelter. Between 2020 and 2022, both the total number of people who used an emergency shelter and their proportion rose. This rise might be attributed to increased financing to support the population experiencing homelessness throughout the COVID-19 pandemic through hotel rooms and increased shelter capacity.</p>
          <p>Most survey respondents (50%) said they presently reside in Barrie, followed by North Simcoe (19%) and Orillia and vicinity (16%). According to the 2016 Census, 30% of Simcoe County's population lived in Barrie, 10% in North Simcoe, 16% in Orillia and vicinity, 16% in South Georgian Bay, and 29% in South Simcoe (Statistics Canada, 2016). According to this data, a higher proportion of the people in Simcoe County who were homeless on January 25th, 2022, lived in Barrie and North Simcoe, while a lower proportion did so in South Georgian Bay and South Simcoe.</p>
          <p>The survey methodology may have an influence on how many people will be homeless on January 25th, 2022. This may be due to difficulties contacting people in more remote locations as well as a concentration of assistance providers in cities with easy access to amenities like public transportation.</p>
